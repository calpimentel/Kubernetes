# Readme

This repo contains all the YAML and other config files for my **Kubernetes for Developers: Integrating Volumes and Using Multi-container Pods** course.

The files are provided as-is, and I do not guarantee they're free from vulnerabilities.

From time-to-time I'll update configurations to use the latest versions of packages etc. When I do this, I will keep the important parts of the files in-sync with the versions used in the videos.
